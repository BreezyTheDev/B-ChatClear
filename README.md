# S-ChatClear

## What is it?

This script is quite simple and self-explanatory, essentially what it does is when you execute the command `/clearchat` it will wipe the chat for everyone and has a follow up message with `The chat has been cleared!`. This is very useful when a user spams chat or uses inappropriate language then you can clear the chat and all the messages that was sent will no longer exist.

## Commands

`/clearchat` - Requires `clearchat.staff` permission. 

`/clearc` - Everyone is allowed to utilize this command. (Clears chat just for the user)

## Logging

Originally I added discord logging to this script but over time I realized it just clutters the discord so I made it appear in chat just for those who have the permission to do ``/clearchat`` only.

## Configuration

The following can be found in the ``server.lua`` file.
```
prefix = '^5[^1Server Name^5] ^3'
```
You can configure the prefix to match your server name.
